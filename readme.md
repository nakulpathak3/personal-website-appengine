# Personal Website

This is my current personal website. You can find it live [here](http://nakulpathak.com).

## Tools

This website started off as a way for me to learn web app development from this [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253) course.
It uses Google App Engine (Python) as the backend. The front end is simple HTML, CSS, jQuery (for the scrolling effect).
